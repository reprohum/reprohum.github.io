# The ReproHum Project

The key goals of the ReproHum project are the development of a methodological framework for testing the reproducibility of human evaluations in NLP, and of a multi-lab paradigm for carrying out such tests in practice, carrying out the first study of this kind in NLP.

Over the course of the project, we will (i) systematically diagnose the extent of the human evaluation reproducibility problem in NLP and survey related current work to address it; (ii) develop the theoretical and methodological underpinnings for reproducibility testing in NLP; (iii) test the suitability of the shared-task paradigm (uniformly popular across NLP fields) for reproducibility testing; (iv) create a design for multi-test reproducibility studies, and run the ReproHum study, an international large-scale multi-lab effort conducting 50+ individual, coordinated reproduction attempts on human evaluations in NLP from the past 10 years; and (v) nurture and build international consensus regarding how to address the reproducibility crisis, via technical meetings and growing an international network of researchers.

# The ReproHum Project
The ReproHum projects aims to define, measure, and improve reproducibility in the field of Natural Language Processing.  The project is funded under [EPSRC grant EP/V05645X/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/V05645X/1).  Reproducibility is one of the cornerstones of scientific research yet experimentla results for NLP systems are seldom reproduced.  Even when they are, results tend to be worse than in the original publication.

The ReproHum project aims improve the current reproducibility situation in NLP.  The main goals are:
* Diagnose the extent of the reproducibility problem in NLP and identify barriers to carrying out replication work.
* Develop a methodological framework for testing the reproducibility of human evaluations in NLP.
* Design then perform the ReproHum multi-lab study where partner labs reproduce human evaluation results from the last 10 years, covering a variety of areas within NLP.  In addition, continue the ReproGen shared task.
* Provide guidance on reproducibility to the NLP community and build a concensus within the community on how NLP as a field can continue to improve in this regard.

The project is funded under [EPSRC grant EP/V05645X/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/V05645X/1).



## Project overview
The project will take place over the 18 months from April 2022.  There are six work packages.


### Survey of NLP researchers
We will shortly be conducting a surveys on the attitudes towards reproducibility in NLP, as well as the barriers that are faced by researchers.


### ReproGen
The ReproGen shared task was first run as [ReproGen 2021](https://reprogen.github.io/2021) and is being run again as [ReproGen 2022](https://reprogen.github.io).  There are two tracks, one where participants can attempt reproduction of human or automated evaluations from a common list of published papers, and a second where participants can reproduct their own prior work.


### Multi-lab reproducibility study
A major part of the ReproHum project is a large multi-lab study where partner labs from across the world will reproduce results from a variety of papers from the last 10 years.  We are still open to new partner labs joining, please contact the organisers (links above).

Partner labs will run reproductions of prior results from a selection of papers.  For each paper, reproduction will by attempted by two labs in the first [degree of reproducibility](https://aclanthology.org/2020.inlg-1.24), with evaluation in increasing degree applied to any papers that are reproducable in a lower degree.


### Quantified Reproducibility Assessment
To obtain a single score estimating the degree of reproducibility of a given system and evaluation measure we will carry out a quantified reproducibility assessment (Belz, 2021).  We will calculate the coefficient of variation with adjustment for small sample size.  Code implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/asbelz/coeff-var)
